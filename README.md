ðŸ’¬ HTML ID Naming Rules
To maintain clean and maintainable HTML, follow these rules for assigning id attributes:

âœ… Use only one unique ID per page

âœ… Use IDs for major layout anchors (e.g., section links, JS targeting)

âœ… Use kebab-case (e.g., contact-form, hero-section)

ðŸš« Do not use IDs for styling â€“ use classes instead

âœ… Reserved Section IDs for DoughPopShop
Please use the following pre-approved IDs for each section of the website:

html
Copy
Edit
<header id="header">...</header>
<section id="hero">...</section>
<section id="new-products">...</section>
<section id="about-us">...</section>
<section id="location">...</section>
<section id="contact-form">...</section>
<footer id="footer">...</footer>
Stick to these IDs to ensure consistency and avoid conflicts during development.
